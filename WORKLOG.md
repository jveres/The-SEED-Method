<!-- Dashboard cluster: first screenful — where are we, what's next, what's blocked -->

## Goal (from `SEED.md`)

Make the SEED Method publicly available and reusable by anyone on GitHub.

## Status

Released v3.5 on 2026-02-14. Next release: planning / not started.

## Next actions

1. Owner: confirm scope for next release (if any)

## Open questions

(No open items.)

<!-- Detail cluster: reference material — how, why, what exactly -->

## Plan

(Next release scope TBD.)

## Tasks

(No active tasks.)

## Proof

See [README.md → Quick Start](README.md#quick-start)

### Environment notes

- No build steps, no dependencies — plain Markdown

### Last known result

(Reset for next release.)

## Decisions

- ASCII art logo style: gradient block Unicode — renders well across terminals and GitHub. [carry-over]
- License: CC BY 4.0 — permissive, appropriate for methodology/documentation. [carry-over]

## Lessons

- ASCII art rendering varies across platforms (terminal vs GitHub vs different fonts) — test in both before committing to a style; expect multiple iterations.
- Logo decision is purely subjective — only the Owner can decide. Don't iterate alone; checkpoint early on aesthetic choices.

## Practices

- Get Owner checkpoint on subjective/aesthetic choices early — prevents wasted iteration on preferences only the Owner can decide.
- Keep repo ceremony proportional to project size — a docs-only repo needs minimal proof (link checks, structure verification), not test frameworks.

## Working set

(Clear.)
